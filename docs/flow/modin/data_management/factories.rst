Factories Module Description
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Brief description
'''''''''''''''''
Modin has several execution backends. Calling any DataFrame API function will end up in
some backend-specific method. The responsibility of dispatching high-level API calls to
backend-specific function belongs to the `QueryCompiler`, which is determined at the time of the dataframe's creation by the factory of
the corresponding backend. The mission of this module is to route IO function calls from
the API level to its actual backend-specific implementations, which builds the
`QueryCompiler` of the appropriate backend.

Backend representation via Factories
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Backend is a combination of the `QueryCompiler` and `Execution Engine`. For example,
``PandasOnRay`` backend means the combination of the ``PandasQueryCompiler`` and ``Ray``
engine. 

In the scope of this module, each backend is represented with a factory class located in
``modin/data_management/factories/factories.py``. Each factory contains a field that identifies the IO module of the corresponding backend. This IO module is
responsible for dispatching calls of IO functions to their actual implementations in the
underlying IO module. For more information about IO module visit :doc:`related doc </flow/modin/engines/base/io>`.

Engine Dispatcher
'''''''''''''''''
The ``modin.data_management.factories.dispatcher.EngineDispatcher`` class provides public methods whose interface corresponds to
pandas IO functions, the only difference is that they return `QueryCompiler` of the
selected backend instead of DataFrame. ``EngineDispatcher`` is responsible for routing
these IO calls to the factory which represents the selected backend.

So when you call ``read_csv()`` function and your backend is ``PandasOnRay`` then the
trace would be the following:

    :align: center

``modin.pandas.read_csv`` calls ``EngineDispatcher.read_csv``, which calls ``.read_csv``
function of the factory of the selected backend, in our case it's ``PandasOnRayFactory._read_csv``,
which in turn forwards this call to the actual implementation of ``read_csv`` — to the
``PandasOnRayIO.read_csv``. The result of ``modin.pandas.read_csv`` will return a Modin
DataFrame with the appropriate `QueryCompiler` bound to it, which is responsible for
dispatching all of the further function calls.
