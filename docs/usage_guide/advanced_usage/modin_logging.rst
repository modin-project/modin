Modin Logging
=============

Modin logging offers users greater insight into their queries by logging internal Modin API calls, partition metadata,
and profiling system memory. When Modin logging is enabled (default disabled), log files are written to a local ``.modin`` directory at the same
directory level as the notebook/script used to run Modin.

The logs generated by Modin Logging will be written to a ``.modin/logs/job_<uuid>`` directory, uniquely named after the job uuid.
The logs that contain the Modin API stack traces are named ``trace.log``. The logs that contain the memory utilization metrics are
named ``memory.log``. By default, if any log file exceeds 10MB (configurable with ``LogFileSize``), that file will be saved and a 
separate log file will be created. For instance, if users have 20MB worth of Modin API logs, they can expect to find ``trace.log.1`` 
and ``trace.log.2`` in the ``.modin/logs/job_<uuid>`` directory. After ``10 * LogFileSize`` MB or by default 100MB of logs, the logs will 
rollover and the original log files beginning with ``trace.log.1`` will be overwritten with the new log lines.

**Developer Warning:** In some cases, running services like JupyterLab in the ``modin/modin`` directory may result in circular dependency issues.
This is due to a naming conflict between the ``modin/logging`` directory and the Python ``logging`` module, which may be used as a default in
such environments. To resolve this, please run Jupyterlab or other similar services from directories other than ``modin/modin``.

Usage examples
--------------

In the example below, we enable logging for internal Modin API calls, partition metadata and memory profiling.
We can set the granularity (in seconds) at which the system memory utilization is logged using ``LogMemoryInterval``.
We can also set the maximum size of the logs (in MBs) using ``LogFileSize``.

.. code-block:: python

  import modin.pandas as pd
  from modin.config import LogMode, LogMemoryInterval, LogFileSize
  LogMode.enable()
  LogMemoryInterval.put(2) # Defaults to 5 seconds, new interval is 2 seconds
  LogFileSize.put(5) # Defaults to 10 MB per log file, new size is 5 MB

  # User code goes here

Disable Modin logging like so:

.. code-block:: python

  import modin.pandas as pd
  from modin.config import LogMode
  LogMode.disable()

  # User code goes here

In Modin the lower-level functionality is logged in debug level, and higher level functionality in info level.
By default when logging is enabled in Modin, both high level and low level functionality are logged.
The below example script could be used to switch between logging all functions vs only logging higher level functions.
Setting logger level to ``logging.INFO`` logs only higher level functions.

.. code-block:: python

  import modin.pandas as pd
  from modin.logging.config import get_logger
  from modin.config import LogMode
  import logging
  LogMode.enable()
  logger = get_logger()
  logger.setLevel(logging.INFO) # Replace with logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  for lower level logs
  df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2], 'col2': [3, 4]})
  df = pd.concat([df, df])


Debugging from user defined functions:

.. warning:: 
    When attempting to use Modin logging in user defined functions that execute in workers for logging lower-level operators
    as in example below, multiple log directories ``.modin/logs/job_**`` would be created for each worker executing the UDF.

.. code-block:: python

  import modin.pandas as pd

  def udf(x):
      from modin.config import LogMode
      
      LogMode.enable()
      
      return x + 1
  
  modin_df = pd.DataFrame([0, 1, 2, 3])
  print(modin_df.map(udf))

So the **recommended** approach would be to use a different logger as in the below snipet
to log from user defined functions that execute on workers.
Below is an an example to log from UDF. For this the logger config has to be specified inside the UDF that would execute on a remote worker.

.. code-block:: python

  import logging
  import modin.pandas as pd
  
  def udf(x):
      logging.basicConfig(filename='modin_udf.log', level=logging.INFO)
      logging.info("This log message will be written to modin_udf.log ")

      # User code goes here
      return x + 1

  modin_df = pd.DataFrame([0, 1, 2, 3])
  print(modin_df.map(udf))
