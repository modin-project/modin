Modin Logging
=============

Modin logging offers users greater insight into their queries by logging internal Modin API calls, partition metadata,
and profiling system memory. When Modin logging is enabled (default disabled), log files are written to a local ``.modin`` directory at the same
directory level as the notebook/script used to run Modin. It is possible to configure whether to log system memory and additional metadata
in addition to Modin API calls (see the usage examples below).

The logs generated by Modin Logging will be written to a ``.modin/logs/job_<uuid>`` directory, uniquely named after the job uuid.
The logs that contain the Modin API stack traces are named ``trace.log``. The logs that contain the memory utilization metrics are
named ``memory.log``. By default, if any log file exceeds 10MB (configurable with ``LogFileSize``), that file will be saved and a 
separate log file will be created. For instance, if users have 20MB worth of Modin API logs, they can expect to find ``trace.log.1`` 
and ``trace.log.2`` in the ``.modin/logs/job_<uuid>`` directory. After ``10 * LogFileSize`` MB or by default 100MB of logs, the logs will 
rollover and the original log files beginning with ``trace.log.1`` will be overwritten with the new log lines.

**Developer Warning:** In some cases, running services like JupyterLab in the ``modin/modin`` directory may result in circular dependency issues.
This is due to a naming conflict between the ``modin/logging`` directory and the Python ``logging`` module, which may be used as a default in
such environments. To resolve this, please run Jupyterlab or other similar services from directories other than ``modin/modin``.

Usage examples
--------------

In the example below, we enable logging for internal Modin API calls.

.. code-block:: python

  import modin.pandas as pd
  from modin.config import LogMode
  LogMode.enable_api_only()

  # User code goes here

In the next example, we add logging for not only internal Modin API calls, but also for partition metadata, remote execution, and memory profiling.
We can set the granularity (in seconds) at which the system memory utilization is logged using ``LogMemoryInterval``.
We can also set the maximum size of the logs (in MBs) using ``LogFileSize``.
**Note:**: Logging should be enabled before any Modin calls, and logging of remote execution calls cannot be disabled once enabled.

.. code-block:: python

  import modin.pandas as pd
  from modin.config import LogMode, LogMemoryInterval, LogFileSize
  LogMode.enable()
  LogMemoryInterval.put(2) # Defaults to 5 seconds, new interval is 2 seconds
  LogFileSize.put(5) # Defaults to 10 MB per log file, new size is 5 MB

  # User code goes here

Disable Modin logging like so:

.. code-block:: python

  import modin.pandas as pd
  from modin.config import LogMode
  LogMode.disable()

  # User code goes here
