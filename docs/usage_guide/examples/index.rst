Modin Usage Examples
====================

This section shows Modin usage examples in different scenarios like Modin on a local/remote cluster,
Modin in the cloud, the use of Modin spreadsheet and whatnot.

Tutorials
---------

The following tutorials cover the basic usage of Modin. `Here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NglkafEmbhE>`_ is a one hour video tutorial that walks through these basic exercises.

- Exercise 1: Introduction to Modin [`Source <https://github.com/modin-project/modin/blob/master/examples/tutorial/tutorial_notebooks/introduction/exercise_1.ipynb>`_]
- Exercise 2: Speed Improvements with Modin [`Source <https://github.com/modin-project/modin/blob/master/examples/tutorial/tutorial_notebooks/introduction/exercise_2.ipynb>`_]
- Exercise 3: Defaulting to pandas with Modin [`Source <https://github.com/modin-project/modin/blob/master/examples/tutorial/tutorial_notebooks/introduction/exercise_3.ipynb>`_]
