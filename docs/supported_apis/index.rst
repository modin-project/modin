Supported APIs
==============

For your convenience, we have compiled a list of currently implemented APIs and methods
available in Modin. This documentation is updated as new methods and APIs are merged
into the main branch, and not necessarily correct as of the most recent release. 

To view the docs for the most recent release, check that you're viewing the 
`stable version`_ of the docs.

In order to install the latest version of Modin, follow the directions found on the
:doc:`installation page </getting_started/installation>`.

Questions on implementation details
-----------------------------------

If you have a question about the implementation details or would like more information
about an API or method in Modin, please contact the Modin `developer mailing list`_.
