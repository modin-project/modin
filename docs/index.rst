Scale your pandas workflow by changing a single line of code
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Modin uses Ray_, Dask_ or Unidist_ to provide an effortless way to speed up your pandas notebooks,
scripts, and libraries. Unlike other distributed DataFrame libraries, Modin provides
seamless integration and compatibility with existing pandas code. Even using the
DataFrame constructor is identical.

.. code-block:: python

  import modin.pandas as pd
  import numpy as np

  frame_data = np.random.randint(0, 100, size=(2**10, 2**8))
  df = pd.DataFrame(frame_data)

It is not necessary to know in advance the available hardware resources in order to use Modin.
Additionally, it is not necessary to specify how to distribute or place data.
Modin acts as a drop-in replacement for pandas, which means that you can continue using your previous
pandas notebooks, *unchanged*, while experiencing a considerable speedup thanks to Modin, even on a single
machine. Once you've changed your import statement, youâ€™re ready to use Modin just like
you would pandas.

Installation and choosing your compute engine
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Modin can be installed from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install modin


If you don't have Ray_, Dask_ or Unidist_ installed, you will need to install Modin with one
of the targets:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install "modin[ray]" # Install Modin dependencies and Ray to run on Ray
   pip install "modin[dask]" # Install Modin dependencies and Dask to run on Dask
   pip install "modin[unidist]" # Install Modin dependencies and Unidist to run on Unidist
   pip install "modin[all]" # Install all of the above

Modin will automatically detect which engine you have installed and use that for
scheduling computation!

If you want to choose a specific compute engine to run on, you can set the environment
variable ``MODIN_ENGINE`` and Modin will do computation with that engine:

.. code-block:: bash

   export MODIN_ENGINE=ray  # Modin will use Ray
   export MODIN_ENGINE=dask  # Modin will use Dask
   export MODIN_ENGINE=unidist # Modin will use Unidist

If you want to choose the Unidist engine, you should set the additional environment 
variable ``UNIDIST_BACKEND``, because currently Modin only supports Unidist on MPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   export UNIDIST_BACKEND=mpi # Unidist will use MPI backend

This can also be done within a notebook/interpreter before you import Modin:

.. code-block:: python

   import os

   os.environ["MODIN_ENGINE"] = "ray"  # Modin will use Ray
   os.environ["MODIN_ENGINE"] = "dask"  # Modin will use Dask

   os.environ["MODIN_ENGINE"] = "unidist" # Modin will use Unidist
   os.environ["UNIDIST_BACKEND"] = "mpi" # Unidist will use MPI backend

   import modin.pandas as pd

Faster pandas, even on your laptop

The ``modin.pandas`` `DataFrame`_ is an extremely light-weight parallel DataFrame. Modin
transparently distributes the data and computation so that all you need to do is
continue using the pandas API as you were before installing Modin. Unlike other parallel
DataFrame systems, Modin is an extremely light-weight, robust DataFrame. Because it is so
light-weight, Modin provides speed-ups of up to 4x on a laptop with 4 physical cores.

In pandas, you are only able to use one core at a time when you are doing computation of
any kind. With Modin, you are able to use all of the CPU cores on your machine. Even in
``read_csv``, we see large gains by efficiently distributing the work across your entire
machine.

.. code-block:: python

  import modin.pandas as pd

  df = pd.read_csv("my_dataset.csv")

Modin is a DataFrame for datasets from 1MB to 1TB+
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

We have focused heavily on bridging the solutions between DataFrames for small data
(e.g. pandas) and large data. Often data scientists require different tools for doing
the same thing on different sizes of data. The DataFrame solutions that exist for 1MB do
not scale to 1TB+, and the overheads of the solutions for 1TB+ are too costly for
datasets in the 1KB range. With Modin, because of its light-weight, robust, and scalable
nature, you get a fast DataFrame at 1MB and 1TB+.

**Modin is currently under active development. Requests and contributions are welcome!**

If you are interested in learning more about Modin, please check out the :doc:`Getting Started</getting_started/quickstart>`
guide then refer to the :doc:`Developer Documentation</development/index>` section,
where you can find system architecture, internal implementation details, and other useful information.
