    Creates an instance of a cluster with desired characteristics in a cloud.
    Upon entering a context via with statement Modin will redirect its work to the remote cluster.
    Spawned cluster can be destroyed manually, or it will be destroyed when the program exits.

    Parameters
    ----------
    provider : str or instance of Provider class
        Specify the name of the provider to use or a Provider object.
        If Provider object is given, then credentials, region and zone are ignored.
    credentials : str, optional
        Path to the file which holds credentials used by given cloud provider.
        If not specified, cloud provider will use its default means of finding credentials on the system.
    region : str, optional
        Region in the cloud where to spawn the cluster.
        If omitted a default for given provider will be taken.
    zone : str, optional
        Availability zone (part of region) where to spawn the cluster.
        If omitted a default for given provider and region will be taken.
    image: str, optional
        Image to use for spawning head and worker nodes.
        If omitted a default for given provider will be taken.
    project_name : str, optional
        Project name to assign to the cluster in cloud, for easier manual tracking.
    cluster_name : str, optional
        Name to be given to the cluster.
        To spawn multiple clusters in single region and zone use different names.
    workers : int, optional
        How many worker nodes to spawn in the cluster. Head node is not counted for here.
    head_node : str, optional
        What machine type to use for head node in the cluster.
    worker_node : str, optional
        What machine type to use for worker nodes in the cluster.
    cluster_type : str, optional
        How to spawn the cluster.
        Currently spawning by Ray autoscaler ("rayscale" for general and "omnisci" for Omnisci-based) is supported

    Returns
    -------
    BaseCluster descendant
        The object that knows how to destroy the cluster and how to activate it as remote context.
        Note that by default spawning and destroying of the cluster happens in the background,
        as it's usually a rather lengthy process.

    Notes
    -----
    Cluster computation actually can work when proxies are required to access the cloud.
    You should set normal "http_proxy"/"https_proxy" variables for HTTP/HTTPS proxies and
    set "MODIN_SOCKS_PROXY" variable for SOCKS proxy before calling the function.

    Using SOCKS proxy requires Ray newer than 0.8.6, which might need to be installed manually.
