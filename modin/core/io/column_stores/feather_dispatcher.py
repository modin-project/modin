        Read data from the file path, returning a query compiler.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str or file-like object
            The filepath of the feather file.
        columns : array-like, optional
            Columns to read from file. If not provided, all columns are read.

        Returns
        -------
        BaseQueryCompiler
            Query compiler with imported data for further processing.
