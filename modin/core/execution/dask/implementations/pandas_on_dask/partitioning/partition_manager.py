        Get the internal indices stored in the partitions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        axis : {0, 1}
            Axis to extract the labels over.
        partitions : np.ndarray
            The array of partitions from which need to extract the labels.

            The function to be used to extract the indices.

        -------
        pandas.Index
            A pandas Index object.

        -----
        These are the global indices of the object. This is mostly useful
