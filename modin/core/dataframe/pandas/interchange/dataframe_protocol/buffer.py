Dataframe exchange protocol implementation.

See more in https://data-apis.org/dataframe-protocol/latest/index.html.

Notes
-----
- Interpreting a raw pointer (as in ``Buffer.ptr``) is annoying and unsafe to
  do in pure Python. It's more general but definitely less friendly than having
  ``to_arrow`` and ``to_numpy`` methods. So for the buffers which lack
  ``__dlpack__`` (e.g., because the column dtype isn't supported by DLPack),
  this is worth looking at again.

    """
    Data in the buffer is guaranteed to be contiguous in memory.

    Note that there is no dtype attribute present, a buffer can be thought of
    as simply a block of memory. However, if the column that the buffer is
    attached to has a dtype that's supported by DLPack and ``__dlpack__`` is
    implemented, then that dtype information will be contained in the return
    value from ``__dlpack__``.

    This distinction is useful to support both (a) data exchange via DLPack on a
    buffer and (b) dtypes like variable-length strings which do not have a
    fixed number of bytes per element.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : np.ndarray
        Data to be held by ``Buffer``.
    allow_copy : bool, default: True
        A keyword that defines whether or not the library is allowed
        to make a copy of the data. For example, copying data would be necessary
        if a library supports strided buffers, given that this protocol
        specifies contiguous buffers. Currently, if the flag is set to ``False``
        and a copy is needed, a ``RuntimeError`` will be raised.
