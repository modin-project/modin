    Compute resulting columns for the two dataframes being merged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : pandas.Index
        Columns of the left frame to join.
    right : pandas.Index
        Columns of the right frame to join.
    left_on : list-like or scalar
        Column names on which the frames are joined in the left DataFrame.
    right_on : list-like or scalar
        Column names on which the frames are joined in the right DataFrame.
    suffixes : tuple[str, str]
        A 2-length sequence containing suffixes to append to the intersected columns.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.Index, dict[IndexLabel -> IndexLabel], dict[IndexLabel -> IndexLabel]
        Returns columns for the resulting frame and mappings of old to new column
        names for `left` and `right` accordingly.

    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        Raised when one of the keys to join is an index level, pandas behaviour is really
        complicated in this case, so we're not supporting this case for now.
