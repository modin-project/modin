class ProtocolColumn(ABC):
    """
    A column object, with only the methods and properties required by the interchange protocol defined.

    A column can contain one or more chunks. Each chunk can contain up to three
    buffers - a data buffer, a mask buffer (depending on null representation),
    and an offsets buffer (if variable-size binary; e.g., variable-length strings).

    TBD: Arrow has a separate "null" dtype, and has no separate mask concept.
         Instead, it seems to use "children" for both columns with a bit mask,
         and for nested dtypes. Unclear whether this is elegant or confusing.
         This design requires checking the null representation explicitly.
         The Arrow design requires checking:
         1. the ARROW_FLAG_NULLABLE (for sentinel values)
         2. if a column has two children, combined with one of those children
            having a null dtype.
         Making the mask concept explicit seems useful. One null dtype would
         not be enough to cover both bit and byte masks, so that would mean
         even more checking if we did it the Arrow way.
    TBD: there's also the "chunk" concept here, which is implicit in Arrow as
         multiple buffers per array (= column here). Semantically it may make
         sense to have both: chunks were meant for example for lazy evaluation
         of data which doesn't fit in memory, while multiple buffers per column
         could also come from doing a selection operation on a single
         contiguous buffer.
         Given these concepts, one would expect chunks to be all of the same
         size (say a 10,000 row dataframe could have 10 chunks of 1,000 rows),
         while multiple buffers could have data-dependent lengths. Not an issue
         in pandas if one column is backed by a single NumPy array, but in
         Arrow it seems possible.
         Are multiple chunks *and* multiple buffers per column necessary for
         the purposes of this interchange protocol, or must producers either
         reuse the chunk concept for this or copy the data?

    This ProtocolColumn object can only be produced by ``__dataframe__``,
    so doesn't need its own version or ``__column__`` protocol.

          or 8 (for byte masks).

        - Endianness isn't too useful, but included now in case in the future
