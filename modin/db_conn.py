Module houses `ModinDatabaseConnection` class.

`ModinDatabaseConnection` lets a single process make its own connection to a
database to read from it. Whereas it's possible in pandas to pass an open
connection directly to `read_sql`, the open connection is not pickleable
in Modin, so each worker must open its own connection.
`ModinDatabaseConnection` saves the arguments that would normally be used to
make a db connection. It can make and provide a connection whenever the Modin
driver or a worker wants one.
