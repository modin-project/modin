        require the implementation to use concatenation or append on the

        (through the API exposed here) has an invariant that requires that
        this object is never returned from a function. It assumes that
        there will always be `BaseFramePartition` object stored and structures
        itself accordingly.

    The abstract methods that need implemented are `apply` and `shuffle`.
    The children classes must also implement `instance_type` and `partition_type`
