            they have some global knowledge about the entire axis. This may
            require the implementation to use concatenation or append on the
            list of block partitions in this object.

            (through the API exposed here) has an invariant that requires that
            this object is never returned from a function. It assumes that
            there will always be `RemotePartition` object stored and structures
            itself accordingly.
